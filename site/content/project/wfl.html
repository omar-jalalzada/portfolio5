Using all that information I developed a traveler's journey map followed by a brainstorming session on which features to build.</div><div class="flex_r flex"> That enabled me to develop the information architecture of the app. I also designed a brand guideline to keep the app experience consistent with the physical tablet experience inside the airports.

      <h3 class="p_section_title">Conclusion</h3>
      <p> Our product proposal was well-received by the WFL executive team; approved to be adopted and budget in the next development cycle. IATA forecasts massive growth in air travel (4 billion more people will be flying annually by 2036). Creating a competitive platform for more technological innovations; encouraging airports and airlines to develop human-centered experiences for all the inconvenient steps in a travelers journey.  </p>

    <div class="flex_r flex">
      <h3 class="p_section_title">Learnings</h3>
      <p>This was an excellent opportunity to learn about traveler psychology and airport wants/needs from technology to leasing agreements. In hindsight, we should've user tested additional scenarios to better identify the more essential features and allocated more time for streamlining the current flight-day flow. It would've helped our final proposal if we kept an executive stakeholder in the loop during the conceptualizing phase of the project.</p>
