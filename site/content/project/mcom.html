      <h3 class="p_role_title sr_direction_down">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="p_role_content sr_direction_down sr_delay_200">The design strategy and detailed documentation of high fidelity prototypes were well received by Macy's executive stakeholders. They commended us for taking a very vague project brief and distill it to specific action items and deliverables. We were subsequently engaged in the next stage of the project. It also inspired an array of new functionalities within the product road-map for the upcoming releases.</p>

      <h3 class="p_role_title sr_direction_down">Learnings</h3>
      <p class="p_role_content sr_direction_down sr_delay_200">We started the project by conducting numerous stakeholder interviews with our client; it helped us understand the tensions among different teams and construct a better project scope. In hindsight, we should've preplanned backup resources for a high profile project like this and avoided delays in the timeline. We should've involved Macys UX team in our early explorations and avoided repeating their tried-but-failed experiments.</p>
