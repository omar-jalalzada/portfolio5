The list is contextually-aware and adapts for a richer in- store experience
Complete the discovery process by using in-store navigation to the product
Provide contextual suggestions determined based on a list’s items and intention eg “holiday”
Allow users to add non-specific items to their lists as reminders or additional ideas
This is how we think as humans
Adding non-specific items to a list replicates a realistic shopping experience

CONCLUSION
The design strategy and prototypes was very well received by Macy's stakeholders and we were subsequently engaged into the next stage of the project. It also inspired an array of new functionalities within the product road-map for the next few releases.

LEARNINGS & FOOTNOTES:
By conducting stakeholder interviews, additional line-items were identified for the project scope. Its very important to plan back-up resources for high profile projects to avoid any adjustments to the overall timeline. 

Thanks to Pauly Ting and his moppy hair-do for all his help.
