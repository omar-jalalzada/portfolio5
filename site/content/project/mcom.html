For product variable filters, use flat navigation opposed to hierarchical for ‘switching’ effect


- PDP Image Gallery

CONCLUSION
The design strategy and prototypes was very well received by Macy's stakeholders and we were subsequently engaged into the next stage of the project. It also inspired an array of new functionalities within the product road-map for the next few releases.

LEARNINGS & FOOTNOTES:
By conducting stakeholder interviews, additional line-items were identified for the project scope. Its very important to plan back-up resources for high profile projects to avoid any adjustments to the overall timeline. 

Thanks to Pauly Ting and his moppy hair-do for all his help.
