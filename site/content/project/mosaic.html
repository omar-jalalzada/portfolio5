      <h3 class="p_section_title">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>We increased the overall adoption of Mosaic by 4x across the board. It became the primary platform on how users across teams collaborated using dashboards. This growth was made possible by building a close relationship with the users (investors and analysts) and implementing a feedback driven design process. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex_r flex">
      <h3 class="p_section_title">Learnings</h3>
      <p>Working on Mosaic was a fantastic opportunity to learn more about the stock market, private investment, and critical analysis. In hindsight, I would've pushed harder to build a design team to accelerate growth and research for new solutions. We would've also benefited from a better prioritization process for the product and design pipelines.</p>
