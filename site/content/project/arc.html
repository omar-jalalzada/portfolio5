We squeezed this project in our weekends and spent about seven days in total drafting the idea and prototypes.  We won the<a href=\"https://aljazeera.devpost.com/updates/1966-announcing-the-winners-of-the-al-jazeera-innovation-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">  second prize. </a>"

It utilizes a nonlinear storytelling to interweave these perspectives and create an insightful, inclusive and well-rounded narrative.

      <h3 class="p_section_title">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>It was gratifying to execute on a time-sensitive project on the side and still manage to take it through my design process, from research/discovery and all the way to iterating/prototyping. In the end, winning the hackathon was an inspiring validation of the idea but we recognize that it needs a lot more polish and thinking.</p>

      <h3 class="p_section_title">Learnings</h3>
      <p>It's essential to accurately assess a side project and understand the amount of work it takes. From ideation to conception we found it challenging to allocate sufficient time, considering all our prior engagements. Heartfelt thanks to Hari Ananth, Lauren Willey and Justin Megahan for all their support.</p>
